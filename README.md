###Bandit Model Research Simulations
This work begins by replicating the multi-armed bandit simulation of Posen & Levinthal (2012), "Chasing a Moving Target: Exploitation and Exploration in Dynamic Environments", Management Science 58(3), pp.587-601.  It extends this into a general-purpose bandit simulation with additional variables that can be manipulated for further research.
